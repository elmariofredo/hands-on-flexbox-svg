### App Server

**[server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-static)** needed for running the app will be installed via present package.json
- run project with auto-reload via "$ webpack-dev-server"
- otherwise build by "$ webpack" and run "$ node server.js"

### Issues

If you have issues with running the dev server, try to install `webpack-dev-server` as a global node packages (`npm install webpack-dev-server -g`).
If there is a problem with font-awesome package. There is a bug in wrong linking modules together. You will need node version 4.0.0 to get it running:
1. install "npm install -g n"
2. $ n 4.0.0
3. $ n (here you chose version 4.0.0)
4. now you should be able to build the project.
